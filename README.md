### **Problem Statement**  
Spam emails are a big problem, cluttering our inboxes with scams, phishing attempts, and unwanted messages. This project focused on building a system to detect and filter out spam emails using Python and machine learning.

### **Project Objectives**  
1. **Cleaned the Data**: Organized the dataset by fixing issues like missing values and preparing the email text for analysis.  
2. **Extracted Features**: Looked at important parts of emails, like the sender, subject, and body, to understand what makes an email spam.  
3. **Tried Different Models**: Tested machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines to find the best one.  
4. **Measured Performance**: Used metrics like accuracy and recall to see how well the model identified spam emails.  
5. **Fine-Tuned the Model**: Adjusted settings to make the model even better at catching spam without marking good emails as spam.  
6. **Validated the Results**: Made sure the model worked well on new, unseen data.  
7. **Deployment**: Discussed how the model could be used in real-life email systems to keep spam out of inboxes.  
8. **Focused on Privacy**: Ensured sensitive email information was handled carefully.

### **Project Highlights**  
- The dataset had **13.41% spam emails** and **86.59% regular emails (ham)**.  
- Common spam words included **‘free,’ ‘call,’ ‘text,’ ‘txt,’** and **‘now.’**  
- The **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model performed best, with a recall score of **98.49%**, meaning it could correctly detect most spam emails.

### **Conclusion**  
This project showed how machine learning can make email inboxes safer. By identifying spam messages accurately, it helps users focus on important emails without worrying about scams or unwanted content.  

**Takeaway**: With tools like this, we’re one step closer to keeping our inboxes clean and secure!
